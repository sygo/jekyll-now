The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club.
==================================================================

*We need to get this out of the way, if you are uncomfortable with these tools you'll have a really hard time moving forward.*

The second rule of Fight Club is: you DO NOT talk about Fight Club! 
====================================================================

*More stuff to get out of the way, you assimilate the first two rules to build muscle memory. Moving forward we shouldn't be talking about these either.*

Third rule of Fight Club: if someone yells "stop!", goes limp, or taps out, the fight is over.
==============================================================================================

*It's getting real now - Metasploit Framework is a great tool, but ultimately you need to understand the ins and outs of what makes an exploit tick.*

Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas.

Sixth rule: the fights are bare knuckle. No shirt, no shoes, no weapons. 
=========================================================================

*It's not all green console font and glamour - Reporting is a crucial part of being a penetration tester, you can pop every host and every server, but if you fail to effectively communicate your findings, it will all be a waste of time and money.*

[Public Penetration Testing Reports](https://github.com/juliocesarfort/public-pentesting-reports)

Evidence Gathering (future blog post - please hold)

Presenting findings (future blog post - please hold)

Adapting your orals to your audience  (future blog post - please hold)

Seventh rule: fights will go on as long as they have to. 
=========================================================

It's not all technical.

And the eighth and final rule: if this is your first time at Fight Club, you have to fight.
