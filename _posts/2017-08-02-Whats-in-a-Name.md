title: Post Ethical Compromise - Let's Start Here
---



ChaosNet was born sitting next to a stranger that during the course of a short flight from Houston to Seattle became a friend. During that flight we talked about a million different things but something he said struck a chord with me: "Did you know that Chinese symbol for 'chaos' literally means "a place of dangerous opportunity"?. It's a great way of seeing things, and while later on I discovered that to be somewhat inaccurate, never the less... here we are.

I think the internet is exactly that: a place of dangerous opportunity. We make of it what we want and it is for the most part a libertarian society, where if you are a malicious person, that's exactly what you do, and if you're a casual user reading your email and updating facebook, you (knowingly or not) share that same space with the bad guys. I find that fascinating and honestly part of the challenge of working in security, as security itself isn't "a thing" as much as it is a feeling - providing security as a service is somewhat of an ethereal proposition, but a crucial one at that. I've always loved the idea of making a difference, when the attainment of that difference is on the eye of the beholder, it's a double edged sword, since in my experience what a client often wants is not even close to what they actually need to accomplish to be secure.

If you're on the internet or if you build a product that has an IP address, you (or it) lives in that space of dangerous opportunity.

With that in mind I want to help further. I want to write posts about every day operational security but also deeper technical posts that might be nearly unless to most internet users. I sincerely hope it helps, you just have to pick and choose what you read.

If you'd like to reach me, shoot me an email at nuno @ chaosnet.io, questions, blog post ideas, critical back-and-forth, all is welcome.
